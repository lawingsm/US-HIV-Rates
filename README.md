Title: US HIV Diagnosis Rates 
This project shows a choropleth map that displays rates of HIV diagnosis per state. This data is taken from the Center for Disease Control
and takes into account state population as well as the rate of diagnosis. The choropleth shading came from color-brewer which provided the name of the 
pallete as well as the HEX codes for each shade. I also used W3 schools to find CSS style tips to help with my map.
